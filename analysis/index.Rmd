# Welcome to Data Visualization in R

This workshop is designed to teach you the fundamentals of creating compelling, publication-quality visualizations using R and ggplot2. Whether you're a biology student, researcher, or data analyst, mastering data visualization is essential for exploring your data and communicating your findings effectively.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

- Understand the principles of effective data visualization
- Create the 6 essential plot types used in 90% of scientific publications
- Apply the grammar of graphics using ggplot2
- Customize plots with themes, colors, and annotations
- Work with real genomics data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
- Create publication-ready figures for your research

## Workshop Structure

### [Lesson 1: Introduction to Data Visualization](01_intro_data_viz.html)
Learn the fundamental principles of effective data visualization, including when to use different plot types and best practices for visual communication.

### [Lesson 2: Practical ggplot2](02_intro_to_ggplot2.html)
Master the core visualization types using real TCGA cancer genomics data:
- Scatter plots and correlation analysis
- Histograms for distribution exploration
- Boxplots and violin plots for group comparisons
- Bar plots for summary statistics

### [Lesson 3: Heatmaps Demystified](03_heatmap_demystified.html)
Deep dive into creating and customizing heatmaps - the 6th essential plot type for genomics research.

### [Lesson 4: Advanced Single-cell RNA-seq Visualization](04_practical_scRNAseq_viz.html)
Specialized techniques for visualizing single-cell RNA sequencing data.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of R programming
- R and RStudio/Positron installed
- Required R packages: `tidyverse`, `readr`, `dplyr`, `ggplot2`

## Data

We'll be working with real-world data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), focusing on gene expression across different cancer types. This provides practical experience with the types of data you'll encounter in genomics research.

## Getting Started

1. Download the [TCGA gene expression dataset](https://osf.io/yeun5)
2. Install required packages:
```r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "readr", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "Polychrome", "forcats"))
```
3. Start with [Lesson 1: Introduction to Data Visualization](01_intro_data_viz.html)
